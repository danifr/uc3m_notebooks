## Summary
In this example, we simulate a single neuron (me-model) and record its membrane potential (v) along with sodium (Na⁺, ina) and potassium (K⁺, ik) ionic currents. By analyzing these currents during an evoked action potential, we observe how Na⁺ and K⁺ shapes the overall waveform of the action potential.
